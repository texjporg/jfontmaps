ptex-fontmaps
=============

Current release: $VER$

The files contained in this package contains font maps for dvipdfmx to
make various Japanese/Chinese/Korean fonts available for (u)ptex and related programs
and formats.

The font maps were written by several people, including (in alphabetic order)
  Hironori Kitagawa
  Norbert Preining
  Saito Shuzaburo
  Takuji Tanaka
  Hironobu Yamashita
and are now maintained in the github.com git repository:
  https://github.com/texjporg/jfontmaps


Free versus non-free
====================
Due to the requirements that TeX Live includes only support for free
software, this package is split into two parts:
* jfontmaps : which contains most of the files and scripts, as well
	as support files for free fonts
* jfontmaps-nonfree : only the support (map) files for non-free fonts

The package `jfontmaps' (this package) is available in TeX Live,
while the package `jfontmaps-nonfree` is *NOT* available directly from the
TeX Live package mirrors, but can be installed from the tltexjp
repository, by executing the following commands:
	tlmgr repository add http://texlive.texjp.org/current/tltexjp tltexjp
	tlmgr pinning add tltexjp '*'
	tlmgr install jfontmaps-nonfree
After that updates for the jfontmaps packages will be automatically
installed.


Families, support, and necessary font files
===========================================
This package does *not* ship any of the fonts mentioned, but only
map files for dvipdfmx. You have to obtain the fonts separately.
For following list of maps, the respective fonts are shipped in TeX Live
and are available for free:

* Japanese: ipa, ipaex
* Simplified/Traditional Chinese: arphic
* Korean: baekmuk, unfonts

For following list of maps, the respective fonts are available for free
but not shipped in TeX Live:

* Japanese: moga-mobo, moga-mobo-ex, ume
* Simplified/Traditional Chinese: cjkunifonts, cjkunifonts-ttf

All other fonts are non-free.

If in the following tables some fonts are marked with 
	'(<= "...")
it means that the fonts are originally named as in given within
the parenthesis, but need to be renamed to the name given first.

O: kanjiVariant '-04' is supported.
P: We have '-04' maps, but fonts lack some glyphs
D: We don't have '-04' maps, so the result depends on the actual glyphs
4: no -04 maps, but all glyphs have automatically JIS2004
9: no -04 maps, and all glyphs have automatically JIS1990 (no JIS2004 glyphs)
